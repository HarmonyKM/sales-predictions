### Task:

- [x] Create a preprocessing object to prepare the dataset for Machine Learning


### Data:
Data Source: [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1syH81TVrbBsdymLT_jl2JIf6IjPXtSQw/view)


## Methods
- 1. Import Libraries
- 2. Load the Data

#### Techniques for cleaning up messy data include the following:
- 3. Explore the Data
#### The aim here is to find the easiest way to rectify quality issues, such as eliminating bad data, filling in missing data or otherwise ensuring the raw data is suitable for feature engineering.

- 4. Fix Inconsistencies in Categorical Data

#### There are a variety of reasons a data set might be missing individual fields of data. Data scientists need to decide whether it is better to discard records with missing fields, ignore them or fill them in with a probable value. 
- 5. Check for Duplicated, Missing or Erroneous Data

#### When two records seem to repeat, an algorithm needs to determine if the same measurement was recorded twice, or the records represent different events.
- 6. Drop Duplicates

#### At this stage, the data is split into two sets. The first set is used to train a machine learning or deep learning model. The second set is the testing data that is used to gauge the accuracy and robustness of the resulting model. 
- 7. Split the Data (Validation Split
- 8. Perform a train/test Split

#### Data Preprocessing involves techniques used by data scientists to organize the data in ways that make it more efficient to train data models 
- 9. Pre-Processing
- 10. Instantiate Column Selectors
- 11. Instantiate Transformers
- 12. Instantiate Pipelines
- 13. Instantiate Column Transformer
- 14. Fit Preprocessor
- 15. Transform Data

## Results

Data preprocessing plays a key role in earlier stages of machine learning and AI application development, as noted earlier. In an AI context, data preprocessing is used to improve the way data is cleansed, transformed and structured to improve the accuracy of a new model, while reducing the amount of compute required.
